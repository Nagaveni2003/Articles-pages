  <h1>Digitalisation of Classrooms in India: Why Technology Needs Thoughtful Balance</h1>
  <p><em>By U R Nagaveni</em></p>

  <p>
    The digitalisation of classrooms in India began much earlier than many people realise.
    I still remember being in first or second standard when e-learning was introduced in my
    school through smart boards. I genuinely enjoyed those classes because they were far more
    engaging than traditional lessons. It almost felt like watching cartoons at school—the
    way the syllabus was planned and taught through videos made learning fun and interesting.
  </p>

  <p>
    However, complete digitalisation of classrooms can also become boring at times.
    Excessive screen use may affect concentration and deep learning. Countries like Sweden
    have already started bringing back paper and pen in classrooms after noticing issues
    related to attention span and learning depth. There were several barriers that emerged,
    showing that digital learning alone is not always effective.
  </p>

  <p>
    This is why futuristic thinking and deep research are essential before implementing
    large-scale digital education systems. It is important to think carefully about the
    level of access being provided, along with ethics, responsibility, and awareness that
    both users and providers must adopt.
  </p>

  <p>
    Access should not be understood solely in terms of device or internet availability.
    It also relates to how students seek and absorb knowledge. At times, learners need
    emotional support and interactive human engagement, which computers cannot fully
    understand or replace. While machines are designed within limited frameworks, human
    emotions, thoughts, and learning abilities are expansive—like a tree with branches that
    keep growing endlessly.
  </p>

  <p>
    Ethics are one of the most important attitudes digital educators must follow today.
    Ethics, awareness, and responsibility should go hand in hand. In digital learning,
    ethics refer to the moral principles that guide respectful, responsible, and honest use
    of educational technologies. Awareness about fair and proper use is equally important.
    In many parts of the world, digital illiteracy still exists, and without parallel
    awareness-building, technology can lead to misuse or unintended consequences.
  </p>

  <p>
    Therefore, while making students digitally knowledgeable, equal effort must be invested
    in building awareness and responsibility. Digital classrooms should support learning,
    not replace the human elements that make education meaningful. Only with thoughtful
    balance can technology truly enhance education.
